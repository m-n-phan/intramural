### 7.1 Design Pillars

1.  **Modern & Sleek** – clean typography (Inter), generous whitespace, 8 px grid rhythm.
2.  **Delightful** – subtle micro‑interactions (200 ms ease‑out), emoji‑grade icons via Lucide, celebratory confetti when seasons end.
3.  **Focus & Clarity** – context‑aware sidebars, progressive disclosure; "one primary action" per screen.
4.  **Consistency** – single source‑of‑truth design tokens shared between web (CSS vars) and mobile (React Native StyleSheet).

### 7.2 Visual Language

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--bg` | #FFFFFF | #1E1E1E | Page background |
| `--surface` | #F7F7F7 | #2B2B2B | Cards, nav bars |
| `--accent` | #2F69FF | #3B83FF | Primary CTAs, links |
| `--border` | #E0E0E0 | #3C3C3C | Dividers, inputs |
| `--text` | #37352F | #E6E6E6 | Primary copy |
| `--text‑muted` | #787774 | #A0A0A0 | Secondary copy |

### 7.3 Layout Patterns

* **Landing (`/`)** – marketing funnel, hero, feature grid, pricing strip, testimonials, FAQ.
* **Dashboard (`/app/*`)** – two‑pane layout on desktop/tablet; stacked views with bottom tabs on mobile.
* **Forms & Tables** – inline validation; sticky action bar with Save / Cancel.
* **Dark Mode** – automatic via `prefers‑color‑scheme` + manual toggle in settings.

### 7.4 Interaction & Motion

* Buttons raise `shadow‑md` on hover (web) or tap‑down animation (mobile).
* Drag‑and‑drop reordering for schedules; haptic feedback on mobile via `expo‑haptics`.
* Live score updates animate with fade‑in tick.
